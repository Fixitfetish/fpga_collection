\brief This file includes the main DOXYGEN documentation page of the FPGA Library.

\mainpage Main FPGA Library Overview

The complete FPGA Library includes the following libraries: 

* \subpage BASE_LIBRARY : general basic packages with types, functions, etc.
* \subpage CPLX_LIBRARY : Complex arithmetic types, functions and build blocks based on the DSP library
* \subpage DSP_LIBRARY  : standard DSP cell related building blocks for multiplications
* \subpage RAM_LIBRARY  : FPGA internal RAM related blocks like FIFO, ROM, Dual-Port RAM, etc.
* \subpage SIG_LIBRARY  : signal processing blocks like modulation, sine/cosine generator, etc.
